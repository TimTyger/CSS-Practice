        <h1>Introduction and Overview </h1>
        <p>Attitude is the foundation and support of everything we do, a key element in the process 
        of controlling your destiny and achieving mastery in your personal and professional life. 
        In fact, the most valuable asset you can possess is a positive attitude toward your life. 
        It isn’t how much you know about maintaining a positive attitude that’s important; 
        it’s how well, and how consistently, you put that knowledge to use. 
        Your attitude is often one of the first things people notice about you.
        The best thing about your attitude is that if it’s bad, it can be made better, 
        and if it’s good, it can be made even greater.</p>

        <p>In the chapters that follow, You’ll learn that no matter how old you are, what your position or 
        station in life, your gender, or your marital status, a positive attitude can make an incredible 
        difference. Each of the steps focuses on fundamental principles of self-development and personal growth. 
        The theme that runs through these steps, like a single strand through a fabric, is that in learning to monitor 
        and control your attitude, you can make an incredible difference in your life and in the lives of people around you. 
        Here is a brief description of each of the steps that will help you develop a super-fantastic attitude.

        <ol> 
            <li><strong>Understand the Power of Attitude</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">Your attitude is a powerful tool for positive action. 
            It’s inherently interwoven into everything you do. It’s your most priceless possession. 
            The good news is, you don’t have to buy it. But you do have to develop it. In the first chapter, 
            you will discover what attitude is, the power of attitude, and how your attitude reflects you. 
            You’ll learn to recognize that you can control your destiny by learning the four things 
            you need to do to stay positive even in the most challenging times.</p>

            <li><strong>Choose to Take Charge of Your Life</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">To transform your attitude into action, you must accept responsibility for what goes on inside 
            your mind by monitoring your internal dialogue. We will look at the power of choice, how your 
            choices determine your happiness and affect your success. I will offer you the keys to controlling 
            how you respond to whatever the world throws at you, by showing you how to monitor and manage your attitude.</p>

            <li><strong>Identify through Self-Awareness the Attitudes That Hold You Back or Propel You Forward</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">By practicing self-awareness, you will learn the three types of bad attitudes. You will discover 
            how to assess your presentday attitude by identifying the things that may be holding you back and 
            to find the attitude needed to propel you forward. You will look at the underlying causes of a bad attitude 
            and discover how to shift turning points into learning points by taking an attitude assessment.</p>

            <li><strong>Reframe Your Bad Attitude</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">An attitude of anger can be transformed into an attitude of gratitude and forgiveness by shifting 
            your perspective. You will discover the power of self-forgiveness, which allows you to forgive others. 
            You will also learn how to recognize and rid yourself of a debilitating attitude by identifying the three 
            P’s that cause a bad attitude.</p>

            <li><strong>Find Your Purpose and Passion</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">Once you’ve determined what has been holding you back, it’s time to look ahead and analyze where you want
             to go. Understanding the importance of living your life with purpose and passion—having a personal 
             vision—is critical to achieving success. You will consider which attitudes are conducive to goal-setting 
             and which can spoil the process. And finally, I will explain the strategy of creating a personal and 
             professional life plan.</p>

            <li><strong>Be Pre-Active</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">In this step, you will learn to prepare yourself for those times when challenging circumstances threaten 
            to provoke negative attitudes that can hinder your plans and throw you off course en route to your goals 
            and dreams. You will discover that even with a positive attitude, purpose, and passion, life is never without 
            challenges, disappointments, setbacks, and problems. By developing a pre-active approach to life, you will become 
            better prepared to handle the hazards you face in life.</p>

            <li><strong>Build Supportive Relationships</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">Nobody makes it alone in this world. We all need supportive relationships to get through challenging times. 
            In this chapter, I will help you put together your A-Team, those people who will help you fight off negative 
            attitudes and build positive ones. To build a team, you first have to develop an attitude that will make 
            others want to support you. I’ll show you how to build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships through 
            networking, shared vision, and shared values. You will also learn the best defense against toxic people who try
             to disrupt your success.</p>

            <li><strong>See Change as an Opportunity</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">One of the greatest challenges to a positive attitude is change, whether it’s a change of jobs, a change 
            in a relationship, or a change in your economic status. We’ll look at the benefits of adopting a whatever
            -it-takes attitude when confronted by change. You will also learn the characteristics of the change process, 
            the four ways individuals respond to it, and ten strategies for embracing change.</p>

            <li><strong>Leave a Lasting Legacy</strong></li>
            <p class="sublist">Sometimes we forget that the greatest thing we can do to build a healthy attitude is to get involved in 
            something greater than ourselves. In Step 10, you’ll learn the benefit of planting positive seeds: seeds of hope,
            encouragement, faith, and love. In this final step, you will discover how you can leave a lasting legacy by 
            making a mark that cannot be erased. You’ll be ready to transcend yourself and reach out to make a difference
            in the lives of your family, friends, and community. If you want a positive attitude, you’re going to need
            to be committed enough to work at it. This book is a guide toward developing the positive attitude that
            will work for you. I will provide you with the information and the plan. It’s up to you to provide the effort and 
            discipline to put the plan into action. It will take some work on your part, but I promise you will get a 
            wonderful return on your investment. Although the process I’ve mapped out is not always easy, I have broken 
            it into small bytes of information and small action steps to make your goals easier to reach. I’ve suggested little 
            adjustments that can change your thinking in a big way. By changing your thinking, you can change your beliefs. 
            By changing your beliefs, you can change your actions—and your life. Remember, this is an investment in you. 
            The light is green, so go! I wish you a super-fantastic journey as you discover the power of your attitude.</p>
